# Overview: 
In this lab, I am building a standalone back-end that is interacting with a static front end. The server.js that I will be will enable me to request data from 6 different third party APIs, modify and flter the data and send it back to the client as needed. 
Further down in the lab assignment, I will be persisting data in a SQL database, essentially creating my own database. 
So I am working with my own serving, requesting info from third party API, persisting data in a SQL database. 

# Getting Started:
1. create a github repository and create all the necessary files that must be in ( server.js; .gitignore, eslintrc.json, package.json)
2.
